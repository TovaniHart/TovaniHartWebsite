This multi-phased project began with a demolition phase to clean and secure the facility. A Temporary Use phase to support the adjacent high school modernization project through providing surge space and a third phase currently in process with design phase services to meet the needs of relocating New Aspire Middle School. This project has included complex master planning including boundary line adjustments and dedication of rights-of-way and persistent involvement with the City of Olympia through complicated changes in how the project is to be permitted. Project highlights include high school competition gymnasium, impressive circulation corridor and the expressed existing, reinforced structure. Phase III will be constructed while students occupy the temporary use space.",

The Owner envisioned continued use as a warehouse with the potential for future retail, or business tenants. Tovani Hart developed a design allowing the current tenant to easily operate, all while giving the street presence of a retail establishment. This building grants the owner flexibility for potential conversion of the space for retail, office, services, or restaurant. The brick façade and entry alcove provide a strong presence and measured relief from the existing 4th Avenue street wall, while façade details, awnings, and the color pallet compliment the historical context of downtown. Interior exposed barrel vault trusses with raw steel connections express the original structure which burned down.",
